# DataPipeline


#### Description

Implementation of a scalable distributed image stream processer using Kafka, Tensorflow, and Spark. This project will demostrate an ETL architecture which will extract many traffic related images coming from multiple different sources (cars), transform each image into its related image embeddings based on OPENAI's CLIP model, and then load all image embeddings into a database for it to be used for analytics (Image search using NLP)
